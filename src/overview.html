	<strong>OdbResource</strong> provides an OrientGraph pool
	implementation a Tomcat realm implemenation for OrientDB and FIlter and
	SessionListener classes to help manage OrientGraph instances in a web
	application.
	<p>The OrientGraph pool implementation works on the principal that
		the web client users will correspond to database logins. This means
		that OrientGraph instances in the pool have logins associated with
		them. When an instance is retrieved from the pool it must have the
		appropriate login associated with it. Hopefully future implementations
		of the pool won't require this hack.</p>
